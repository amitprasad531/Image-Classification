# Image-Classification

This is my solution for the second project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation. In this project, I have used convolution networks to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. As the results indicate, more complex models need to be applied to improve accuracy.

Python and Tensorflow were used to code, create and run the model. The main output file is dlnd_image_classification.ipynb.
